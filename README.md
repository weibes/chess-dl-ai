# chess-dl-ai
Chess AI using ML/DL experimentation.

This is just a testing repo where I plan on creating a bot that can play chess.

Using TensorFlow, NumPy for training and data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, and python-chess for integration with UCI (Universal Chess Interface).


## Installation:
Simply create a venv or conda environment, and run `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` in terminal while in the main directory.
